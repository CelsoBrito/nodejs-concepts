 > Challenge on NodeJS concepts applied to the goStack bootcamp.

ðŸš€ This project is based on the goStack NodeJS concept challenge, a Rocketseat bootcamp.


It was to implement an application to store repositories in my portfolio, which will allow the creation, listing, update and removal of the repositories, and also allow the repositories to receive "likes".

Made with ðŸ’œ by me.
